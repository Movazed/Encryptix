## Overview

Credit card fraud is a prevalent issue that affects financial institutions and cardholders globally. Machine learning offers effective solutions to detect fraudulent transactions based on patterns and anomalies in transaction data.

This project explores various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP Classifier, and SVM to develop a robust fraud detection model. Evaluation metrics like precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical credit card transactions. Each transaction is labeled as fraudulent or genuine. The dataset is not included in this repository due to confidentiality. However, similar datasets can be obtained from sources like Kaggle or through financial institutions (with appropriate permissions).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/credit_card_fraud_detection.git
   cd credit_card_fraud_detection
